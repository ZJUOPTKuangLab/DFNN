This folder is the default storage path for the best weights during the training process. 
Two weights are saved and provided here for testing our network performance.
Naming rule of weights follows by ../<gradient number>_<Dz>_<DatasetName>/weights.best.h5.
For example, grad2_0.3um_0.3um denotes gradient numbers=2, Dz=0.3um, and the training dataset names 0.3um.
