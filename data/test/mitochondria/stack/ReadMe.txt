# This folder contains images from a z image stack. There are three parameters to focus on: 

for example:
cell2G2Dz0p3um_ch0_stack0001_488nm_0003524msec_0002913748msecAbs0032

<cell2>              
the name of the cell

<G2Dz0p3um>  
pattern information: multi-depth pattern of two gradients with Dz of 0.3 um (G2#0.3)

<0032>              
the order of the image in the original z image stack. Therefore, the amount of defocus can be calculated as: (51-order)*dz = (32-51)*0.05 = -0.95 um
