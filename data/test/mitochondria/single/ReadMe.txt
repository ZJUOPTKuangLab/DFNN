# This folder contains images illuminated by a multi-depth lattice pattern with different amounts of defocus in a single shot.

# Naming conventions

for example:
# cell2G2Dz0p3umOffM0p1um

<cell2>              
the name of the cell

<G2Dz0p3um>  
pattern information: multi-depth lattice pattern of two gradients with Dz of 0.3 um (G2#0.3)

<Off>               
the image is defocus ( 'ON' for the in-focus image)

<M>             
Minus, denotes the deviation direction of the z galvo ( 'P' for Plus)

<0p1um>       
0.1um, the amount of defocus pre-set
