# This folder contains images from a z image stack. There are three parameters to focus on: 

for example:
cell11G3Dz0p5um_ch0_stack0001_488nm_0004525msec_0007559766msecAbs0036

<cell11>              
the name of the cell

<G3Dz0p5um>  
pattern information: multi-depth pattern of three gradients with Dz of 0.5 um (G3#0.5)

<0036>              
the order of the image in the original z image stack. Therefore, the amount of defocus can be calculated as: (51-order)*dz = (36-51)*0.05 = -0.75 um
