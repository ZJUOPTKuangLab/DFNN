# This folder contains images illuminated by a multi-depth lattice pattern with different amounts of defocus in a single shot.

# Naming conventions

for example:
# cell11G3Dz0p5umOffM0p1um

<cell11>              
the name of the cell

<G3Dz0p5um>  
pattern information: multi-depth lattice pattern of three gradients with Dz of 0.5 um (G3#0.5)

<Off>               
the image is defocus ( 'ON' for the in-focus image)

<M>             
Minus, denotes the deviation direction of the z galvo ( 'P' for Plus)

<0p1um>       
0.1um, the amount of defocus pre-set

NOTEï¼š
During the experiment, we have re-acquired the in-focal image due to some unexpected mistakes. 
The applicable scope of the corresponding in-focus image is listed as follows:
<cell11G3Dz0p5umON(1).tif> used for images with defocus of M0p2um, P0p2um, P0p3um, M0p4um, P0p4um, M0p5um, P0p5um, M0p6um, P0p6um, M0p7um, and P0p7um.
<cell11G3Dz0p5umON.tif> used for images with defocus of M0p1um, P0p1um, and M0p3um.
